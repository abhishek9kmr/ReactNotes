To do
====

1)Check footer in ios and android.
2)ServiceList.js/Search(now carpenters)- Test in IOS.(normalize is replaced with horizontalScale).
If it works apply it on other flatlists.
3)JobDetail.js and jobDetail1.js
4)Cancel Request popup has been removed from figma.
5)Service Detail- The profile image size has been reduced. The name
   and star rating has been center aligned with the image to make a standard design(Not as per figma). If the name is made
parallel with '2 days ago' then image will get over the text '2 days ago' and affect the top padding.
