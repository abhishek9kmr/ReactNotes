//You can display a text a given number of times in React Native by using the Array constructor's fill()
//method to create an array of the desired length, and then using the map() method to render
//the text component the required number of times. Here's an example

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const text = 'Hello World!';
  const numTimes = 5;

  const textArray = Array(numTimes).fill(text);

  return (
    <View>
      {textArray.map((item, index) => (
        <Text key={index}>{item}</Text>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;

//In this example, we create a text variable containing the text we want to display, and
//a numTimes variable containing the number of times we want to display it. We then use the Array constructor's fill() method
//to create an array of length numTimes filled with the text variable.

//We then use the map() method to loop through the textArray and render a Text component for each item in the array,
//using the key prop to assign a unique identifier to each component. The text variable is passed as the child of the Text component, 
//which will render the text on the screen the required number of times.
